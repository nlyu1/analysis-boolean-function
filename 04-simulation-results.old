# Classical simulation results
The pioneering works by [@terhal2002classical] and 
[@jozsa2008matchgates] provide classical simulation 
methods for Gaussian circuits under two different conditions, 
subsequently unified and generalized by [@brod2016efficient]. 
To the best of our knowledge, [@hebenstreit2020computational] 
provides the comprehensive catalogue of the computational power of 
fermionic Gaussian circuits under various conditions. 


## Computational-basis input and measurement

This work [@terhal2002classical] is the first to draw the connection 
between Valiant's matchgates and noninteracting fermions. 
It is shown that Gaussian circuits 
with computational basis input and computational-basis von-Neumann measurements 
are both strongly and adaptively simulable. 

### Insightful special case 
Let us first consider a subclass of number-preserving Gaussian unitaries 
and projective measurements in the computational basis. 
This case suffices to show the main insight of the paper. 

::: {.definition #npunitary name="number-preserving unitary"}
A Gaussian unitary $U$ is number-preserving if it does not mix annihilation 
and creation operators. The following operator $(V_{jk})$ is unitary 
\[ 
    U a_j^\dag U^\dag = V_{jk} a_k^\dag\implies 
    U^\dag a_j^\dag U = V^\dag_{jk} a_k^\dag, \quad U^\dag a_j 
    U = (V_{jk}^\dag)^* a_k = V_{kj} a_k
\] 
Note that $U$ preserves the hamming weights of computational basis states. 
In particular, $U|0\ra = |0\ra$. 
:::

::: {.proposition #compbasismeasurement name="computational basis measurement"} 
Let $|I\ra, |K\ra$ be computational basis states. 
:::
One can efficiently compute $\la K|U|I\ra$ by the following procedure. Consider 
\begin{aligned} 
    U|I\ra 
    &= U a^\dag_I |0\ra = U a_I^\dag U^\dag (U|0\ra) 
    = \sum_{j_1\cdots j_i} V_{I_1j_1}\cdots V_{I_iJ_i} 
    a_{j_1}^\dag \cdots a_{j_i}^\dag |0\ra 
\end{aligned}
When paired with $\la K|$, only when $(j_l)$ is a permutation of $K$ 
will this be nonzero, then 
\[ 
    \la K|U|I\ra = \sum_{J\in \pi(K)} \mrm{sgn}(J) V_{IJ} = \det V_{|IK} 
\] 
Here $\pi(K)$ denotes permutations of $K$ and 
$V_{|IK}$ is the $i\times i$ matrix which selects the $I$ rows 
and $K$ columns of $V$.  


### Generalization
::: {.theorem #cimoStrongSimulation name="strong simulation"} 
Given a Gaussian unitary $U$ acting on a computational basis $|J\ra$, 
the probability $\Pr(K^*|J)$, where $K^*$ of measuring any subset 
$K\subset [2n]$ of the qubits and finding the bitstring $K^*\in \{0, 1\}^k$, 
is efficiently classically computable. 
:::

The proof extends that of the special case \@ref(prp:compbasismeasurement). 
One generalizes computational-basis projective to 
von-Neumann measurement by applying Wick's theorem and 
recognizing the sum as a Pfaffian of a cleverly-constructed matrix 
(instead of the determinant). 
The generalization from number-preserving to parity-preserving Gaussian unitaries 
is done by using the majorana instead of the dirac operators. 

Constructing the matrix whose Pfaffian yield the desired quantity 
is quite technical. 
A much more insightful interpretation is that this problem reduces to computing 
the overlap between $U|J\ra$ and the binary Hermitian observable corresponding to $K^*$. 
Both are Gaussian, so the Gaussian overlap formula 
\@ref(thm:GaussianOverlap) applies. The next result follows. 

::: {.theorem #cimoAdaptiveSimulation name="adaptive simulation"} 
Adaptive Gaussian circuits with computational-basis input and computational-basis 
von-Neumann measurements are adaptively simulable. 
:::



## Bounded output support
The main results of [@jozsa2008matchgates] are 

- Decomposition of matchgates into $2$-qubit unitaries. 
- Strong simulation for Gaussian circuits with arbitrary product-state input 
and measurement with bounded majorana support. 
- Proof that swap constitutes a resourceful operation. 

### Matchgate decomposition and simulation
::: {.theorem name="nearest-neighbor (n.n.) matchgate"}
Gaussian unitaries with support on nearest-neighbor (consecutive 
two) qubits is of the form 
\[ 
    G(A, B) = \begin{pmatrix}
        p &&& q \\  & w & x &  \\ & y & z & \\ r &&& s 
    \end{pmatrix}, \quad A = \begin{pmatrix}
    p & q \\ r & s\end{pmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{pmatrix}
    w & x \\ y & z \end{pmatrix}
\] 
where $A, B$ are both unitary and $\det B = \det B$. 
this amounts to $A, B$ acting on the even and odd subspaces, respectively. 
:::

_Proof:_ The hermitian quadratic majorana monomials on two qubits are 
\[ 
    \{-i\gamma_1\gamma_2, -i\gamma_2\gamma_3, i\gamma_3\gamma_3, -i\gamma_2\gamma_4, 
    i\gamma_1\gamma_4, -i\gamma_3\gamma_4\} = \{ZI, XX, YX, XY, YY, IZ\}
\] 
They are all traceless and preserve the even and odd subspaces, so the 
Lie group they generate must be $SU(2)\oplus SU(2)$ decomposed relative to the 
two parity subspaces. Alternatively one may construct the Pauli $X, Y, Z$ 
operators acting on the two subspaces and apply direct exponentiation. 

::: {.theorem name="n.n. decomposition of Gaussian unitaries"}
Any Gaussian unitary over $n$ qubits is decomposable into $O(n^3)$ 
n.n. Gaussian unitary. 
::: 

_Proof:_ a Gaussian unitary $U$ affect rotation $R$ of the $2n$ operators. 
Use Euler-angle decomposition to decompose $R$ into a composition of 
$O(n^2)$ rotations, each only acting nontrivially on a two-dimensional subspace. 
Each such rotation can then be implemented by $O(n)$ Gaussian unitaries using 
the modified swap 
\[ 
    S_{12} = \exp\left(-\df \pi 4 (-\gamma_1\gamma_4 + \gamma_2\gamma_3 
    + \gamma_1\gamma_2 + \gamma_3\gamma_4)\right) = -iG(Z, X), \quad 
    S_{12}^\dag \begin{pmatrix}
    \gamma_1 \\ \gamma_2\end{pmatrix}S_{12} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} \gamma_3 \\ \gamma_4\end{pmatrix}
\] 

::: {.theorem name="strong simulation"} 
strong simulation of non-adaptive Gaussian circuit with product state 
input and single-qubit computational-basis output is poly-time. 
:::

_Proof:_ Let the input be $|\psi\ra = \otimes |\psi_j\ra$ and the 
measurement $Z_1 = -i\gamma_1\gamma_2$, then 
\[ 
    \la Z_1\ra = (-i) \la \psi|U^\dag \gamma_1\gamma_2 U|\psi\ra 
    = (-i) \sum_{j\neq k} R_{1,j}R_{2,k} \la \psi|\gamma_j\gamma_k|\psi\ra 
\] 
By virtue of $|\psi\ra$ being a product state, $\la \psi|\gamma_j\gamma_k|\psi\ra$ 
is poly-computable.  

### Resourcefulness of swap 

::: {.theorem name="universality of "}
Any Gaussian unitary over $n$ qubits is decomposable into $O(n^3)$ 
n.n. Gaussian unitary. 
::: 


## Generalization

Brod shows that Gaussian circuits 
with arbitrary product states input and arbitrary product-state 
intermediate measurements remain classically simulable [@brod2016efficient]. 

### Product input and measurement simulation 

First note three useful identities: for arbitrary single-qubit state $|\phi\ra$ 

- $G(H, H)|\phi\ra |+\ra = (H|\phi\ra)|+\ra$
- $G(Z, X)|\phi\ra |0\ra = |0\ra|\phi\ra, \quad 
G(Z, X)|0\ra|\phi\ra = |\phi\ra|0\ra$
- $G(-Z, X)|\phi\ra |1\ra = |1\ra|\phi\ra, \quad 
G(-Z, X)|1\ra|\phi\ra = |\phi\ra|1\ra$

Recall that single-qubit $Z$-rotations and $H$ generate all single-qubit gates. 
Therefore one may prepare arbitrary product state, using only Gaussian operations, 
using the help of a $|+\ra$ ancilla as follows: 

- Prepare $|0\ra |+\ra\mapsto |\psi_1\ra |+\ra$ on the last two qubits. 
- Swap the last of the $n$ qubits to the first register using $G(Z, X)$s 
to obtain $|\psi_1\ra \cdots |0\ra|+\ra$. 
- Prepare $|0\ra|+\ra \mapsto |\psi_2\ra|+\ra$ on the last two qubits, and repeat. 

This yields the following proposition. 

::: {.proposition #freeEquivProductState} 
Let $|\psi\ra$ be a product $n$-qubit state of single-qubit states, then 
$|\psi\ra|+\ra$ is Gaussian-equivalent to $|0\ra^{\otimes n}|+\ra$. 
:::


::: {.theorem #pimoSimulation name="product-input multiple-output strong simulation"} 

Let $\{M_n\}$ be a uniform family of (possibly adaptive) quantum 
circuits with $\poly(n)$ Gaussian unitaries over $n$ qubits acting 
on an arbitrary $n$-qubit product state $|\psi\ra = \otimes |\psi_n\ra$. 
The circuit is strongly, as well as adaptively simulable 
for von-Neumann computational-basis intermediate measurements. 
:::

_Proof_: Let the measurement projector be $P_{\tilde y}$. Note that 
\[ 
    |+\ra = \df {1+a_{n+1}^\dag} {\sqrt 2}|0\ra 
\] 
The quantity of interest thus becomes 
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
    \Pr(\tilde y|\psi) 
    &= \df 1 2 \la 0_{n+1}|(1+a_{n+1})U^\dag M_n^\dag P_{\tilde y}M_n U(1+a_{n+1}^\dag)|0_{n+1}\ra \\ 
    &= \df 1 2 \la 0_{n+1}|a_{n+1}U^\dag M_n^\dag P_{\tilde y}M_n Ua_{n+1}^\dag|0_{n+1}\ra 
    + \df 1 2 \la 0_{n+1}|U^\dag M_n^\dag P_{\tilde y}M_n U|0_{n+1}\ra \\ 
\end{aligned}(\#eq:simulationProb)\end{equation}
Of the product $(1+a_{n+1})\cdots (1+a_{n+1}^\dag)$, only the terms 
$(\cdots)+a_{n+1}\cdots a_{n+1}^\dag$ yield nonzero matrix elements; this is 
by Wick's theorem, which states that creation and annihilation operators must be 
pairwise contracted to yield a scalar element (the only normal-ordered operator 
with nonvanishing vacuum matrix element). 
One may then recognize $\Pr(\tilde y|\psi)$ as a sum of two Pfaffians via 
the construction of \@ref(thm:cimoStrongSimulation). Adaptive simulation follows 
from projective measurements $P_j$ being parity-preserving. 

::: {.theorem #pimoweakSimulation name="product-input multiple-output weak simulation"} 

The circuit in \@ref(thm:pimoSimulation) 
is weakly simulable for arbitrary product-state von-Neumann measurements. 
:::

_Proof_: By use of an ancilla in $|+\ra$, we can perform arbitrary single-qubit 
gate on the last qubit and rotate the measurement basis to a $Z$-measurement. 
Doing this measurement collapses the last qubit to $|0\ra$ or $|1\ra$, upon which 
we can adaptively f-swap the last and second-last qubits using $G(\pm Z, X)$ 
and repeat measurement of the second-last qubit, and so on. 
This provides weak simulation (sampling scheme) of 
rbitrary product-state input and measurement 
on the last $k$ qubits. The proof concludes by 
the freedom to re-order fermionic modes.  


### Insightful perspective: affine Gaussian overlap
One may see that the single-qubit product state $|\psi\ra$ is affine-Gaussian 
equivalent to $|0\ra^{\otimes n}$ using a similar protocol. 
Affine Gaussians include single-qubit unitaries on the first qubit 
in addition to even Gaussian unitaries. 
One can prepare $|\psi_n\ra\cdots |\psi_1\ra$ on the first 
qubit and f-swap them to their respective positions using $G(Z, X)$; 
in other words, every single-qubit product state is affine-Gaussian equivalent 
to $|0\ra^{\otimes n}$. 
Then $\Pr(\tilde y|\psi)$ as in \@ref(eq:simulationProb) is the tracial overlap 
between the even-Gaussian Hermitian $P_{\tilde y}$ and the affine Gaussian 
$U|0\ra^{\otimes n}$, where $U$ is an affine Gaussian unitary. 

We can extend the Gaussian overlap formula \@ref(thm:GaussianOverlap) to the 
case when one of the two operators is not homogeneously even, since they will 
continue to commute. This constitutes another proof of theorem \@ref(thm:pimoSimulation). 

::: {.theorem #affGaussianOverlap name="affine-Gaussian operator overlap"}
Given Gaussian operators $X, Y$ and $Y$ affine 
\[ 
    X(\eta) = \exp\left(\df i 2 \eta^T A\eta\right), \quad 
    Y(\theta) = \exp\left(\df i 2 \theta^T B\theta + b^T\theta\right)
\] 
Using theorems \@ref(thm:affGaussianIntegral) and \@ref(thm:tracialOverlap) 
yields 
\[ 
    \tr(XY) = (-2i)^n \Pf(A)\Pf(B - A^{-1})
\] 
:::

_Proof:_ $X(\eta)$ and $Y(\theta)$ continue to commute, then 
\begin{aligned}
    \tr(XY)
    &= (-2)^n \int D\theta\, D\eta \, e^{\theta^T\eta} X(\eta) Y(\theta) \\ 
    &= (-2)^n \int D\theta \exp\left(\df i 2 \theta^T B\theta+b^T\theta\right) 
    \int D\eta \, e^{\theta^T\eta} 
    \exp\left(\df i 2 \eta^T A\eta\right) \\ 
    &= (-2)^n \int D\theta \exp\left(\df i 2 \theta^T B\theta+b^T\theta\right) 
    i^n \Pf(A) \exp\left(-\df i 2 \theta^T A^{-1} \theta\right) \\ 
    &= (-2i)^n\Pf(A) \int D\theta \exp\left[\df i 2 \theta^T (B-A^{-1})\theta+b^T\theta\right] \\ 
    &= (-2i)^n \Pf(A)\Pf(B - A^{-1})
\end{aligned}
Recall that affine terms of the Gaussian only affect odd moments 
so $b^T\theta$ does not affect the final integral. 

## Magic states

Josza's work [@hebenstreit2019all] provides a characterization of 
resourceful states for Gaussian unitaries. 

### Measurement-based universal computation
::: {.theorem #qchardSimulation name="swap gadget construction"} 

weak simulation of Gaussian circuits with magic-state input and 
adaptive measurements is QC-hard.
:::
_Proof:_ It suffices to construct a protocol equivalent to universal 
quantum computation.

### Characterization of magic states 


## Complexity landscape
The computational power of a circuit model depends on the following ingredients 

- _Gate set:_ here we always consider Gaussian unitaries. 
- _Input states (IN):_ computational basis (CB), general single-qubit product states (PROD), 
magic states (MAGIC)
- _Intermediate measurements_ (ADAPT)
- _Final measurement (M):_ single-qubit (ONE) or multi-qubit product-state (PROD) measurements. 

The following theorems, together with aforementioned results, 
completely establish the simulation complexity landscape 
of Gaussian circuits in terms of adaptiveness, input state (product or magic), 
output (single-qubit or multiple), and weak or strong simulation.
