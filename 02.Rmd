# Influence and Spectral Learning

## Influence, Noise Stablity, and Social Choice {#Sec2}
This subsection corresponds to Chapter 2. Our focus is on 
the uniformity and dependence behavior of functions on their inputs. 

### Social choice functions {-}
A boolean function $\P^n\to \P$ may also be viewed 
as a voting function for an election with $2$ candidates 
and $n$ voters. The most common voting function, for odd $n$ 
is 
\[ 
    \maj_n(x) = \sgn\left(\sum x_j\right)
\] 

:::{.definition name="dictator, junta"}
The $i$-th dictator (projection) function is $\chi_i(x) = x_i$. 
Similarly, a function $\P^n\to \P$ is a $k$-junta if it depends 
upon _at most_ $k$ input coordinates. Informally, a function 
is a junta if it depends on a constant number of coordinates. 
:::

:::{.definition name="weighted majority (linear threshold) function"}
$f$ is a weighted majority function or, equivalently, a (linear) 
threshold function if, for some $a\in \R^n$ 
\[ 
    f(x) = \sgn(a\cdot x)
\] 
A depth-$d$ recursive majority of $n$ functions, denoted $\maj_n^{\otimes d}$ 
is a function of $n^d$ bits defined inductively 
\[ 
    \maj_n^{\otimes (d+1)}(x^{(1)}, \cdots, x^{(n)}) = 
    \maj_n(
        \maj_n^{\otimes d}(x^{(1)}), \cdots, \maj_n^{\otimes d}(x^{(n)})
    )
\] 
:::
:::{.definition name="tribes function"}
The tribes function of width $w$ and size $s$ $\Tribes_{ws}:\P^{ws}\to \P$ is 
\[ 
    \Tribes((x_{ws})) = \bigcup_{j=1}^s \left(\bigcap_{k=1}^w x_{ws}\right)
\] 
There are $s$ tribes, each containing $w$ elements.

### Dependence properties {-}
:::{.definition name="miscellaneous properties"} 
$f:\P^n\to \P$ (naturally extending to codomain $\R$) is

- monotone if $x\leq y\implies f(x)\leq f(y)$ where $x\leq y$ is defined coordinate-wise. 
- odd if $f(-x) = -f(x)$. 
- unanimous if $f(1, \cdots, 1)=1$ and $f(-1, \cdots, -1)=-1$. 
- symmetric if $f\circ \pi = f$ for all permutations. In other words, $f$ only depends 
    on the weight of $x$.
::: 
:::{.theorem name="May's theorem"} 
$f:\P^n \to \P$ is symmetric and monotone if and only if 
$f(x)=\sgn(1\cdot x+a_0)$. If $f$ is additionally odd, then $n$ must be odd 
and $f=\maj_n$. 
:::
_Proof:_ Symmetry demands $f(x)=g(1\cdot x)$ for some $g:\mbb N\to \R$. 
One may show that $y\mapsto \sgn(|y|+a_0)$ is the only admissible choice. 

Properties of functions we have seen so far: 

- Majority function for $n$ odd has all four properties. 
- The dictator function is monotone, odd, and unanimous, so do recursive majority functions. 
- Tribes functions are monotone, unanimous, and transitive-symmetric. 

:::{.definition name="transitive symmetry"}
$f$ is transitive-symmetric if for all $j, k\in [n]$ there exists 
a permutation $\pi\in S_n$ with $\pi(j)=k$ such that 
$f\circ \pi = f$. 

Symmetry demands that _all_ arrangements of coordinates are equivalent. 
Transitive symmetry only demands that every pair of coordinates are equivalent. 
:::

:::{.definition name="impartial culture assumption"}
The impartial culture assumption assumes that all $n$ voters' 
preferences are independent and uniformly random. This corresponds to 
voting in the absence of information.

### Influence and derivatives {-}
Given a coordinate $i\in [n]$ and binary string $x$, let $x^{\oplus i}$ denote 
the same string except with the $i$-th component flipped. 

:::{.definition name="pivot, influence"}
A coordinate $i\in [n]$ is pivotal for $f$ on input $x$ if 
$f(x)\neq f(x^{\oplus i})$. The influence of $i$ on $f$ is the probability 
that $i$ is pivotal for random input: 
\[  
    \Inf_i[f] = \Pr[f(\mbf x)\neq f(\mbf x^{\oplus i})]
\]
